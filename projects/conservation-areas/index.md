A conservation area is an area considered worth preserving or enhancing. They are defined by local authorities and impact the allowable developments in that area.

Conservation areas have been around since 1967. This means a lot of the information about a conservation area is locked up in documents. And the boundary that defines the area the conservation area covers is usually held in a Local authority's GIS.

Neither of these are readily available as data. The digital land is looking into conservation areas to see what data can be produced from the information available and how this data can be combined to make a national dataset.

## Why we are looking at conservation areas

They exist in document form, are well understood as a concept and are often listed on a local authority website.

They contain a geometries that are defined by local authorities. Previously, we've collected geometries from ONS so this allows us to explore what we need to do to collect them from local authorities and test our approach on real data.

## Milestones

[Guidance](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/conserving-and-enhancing-the-historic-environment) exists to help local authorities create and publish conservation area data.
