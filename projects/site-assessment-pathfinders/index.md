Funded pathfinder projects intend to test digital and data aspects of planning reforms. These reforms are set out in the [planning white paper](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/planning-for-the-future). The projects will inform policy and demonstrate how the reforms can benefit the local government sector.
